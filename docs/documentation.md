# Takeoff Documentation

The documentation of Takeoff is generated using Jekyll and Github pages. The theme was selected for
its simplicity.

You need to have `ruby` and [`bundler`](http://bundler.io/) installed.

In the root folder type `bundler install`.  If you have any installation problems, check you have
the `-dev` libraries installed on your system for example `libffe-dev`.

Then type `bundle exec jekyll serve`.  This will generate a `_site` folder and serve it on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

You can also view this documentation at [http://takeoff.sh](http://takeoff.sh)
